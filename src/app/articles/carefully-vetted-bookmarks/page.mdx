### Public Bookmarks

Occasionally, I have a filtering session when I go through every bookmark collected over the years lurking online and narrow them down; however, extra items appear until the next filtering session, and the same goes. It is a vicious cycle.

Regardless of the effort spent maintaining the perfect bookmarked list, it is sad how most bookmarked items never get viewed or are postponed to eternity.

This is only a fraction of my bookmarks, carefully vetted, and chosen links. Open them with love and care.

**Movies**

I had a huge movie database where I tracked all the movies I'd watched, but I threw it away one day as I developed an unhealthy relationship with the database.

I would watch the movie only because I wanted to grow the database, rather than enjoy the film.

This traumatic experience made my brain forget all the movies to protect me, except for a few Hindi films for unknown reasons.
